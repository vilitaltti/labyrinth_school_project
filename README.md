Simple 3D labyrinth project developed for Aalto university's course CS-A1121

Uses graph for developing maze and Dijktra's algorithm to solve the maze. 

TODO: 
    - Graphical interface is still bugy and location of player is no exact 
    - Menu and player movement
    - Larger test cases for the methods and classes
    - Creating more efficient code 
    

## Dependencies: 
python-qt5 (for graphical user interface) 

## How to use:
Run graphical testing script by following command: "python3 test_gui.py" 


## Used hours for the project
    Approximately 7-9 days about ~ 56-72 h
